# Global-Landslide-Catalog-Dashboard-

## Description 
This project analyzes and visualizes landslide data globally using interactive dashboards built with Dash and Plotly. It includes key insights into the frequency, causes, and impact of landslides across different countries, with a focus on fatalities and temporal trends.

## Dataset
The dataset was sourced from the Humanitarian Data Exchange: https://data.humdata.org/dataset/global-landslide-catalogue-nasa#
The dataset contains the global landslide catalogue by NASA that was collected from 1970-2019. It was mostly sourced from generated news feed all over the world and captures mostly rain-induced landslide.
